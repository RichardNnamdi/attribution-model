During our recent product launch, we ran campaigns across multiple marketing channels to promote our new offering. As the launch progressed, it became crucial to understand the performance of our ads, the return on ad spend (ROAS), and how our target audience interacted with the ads across these channels. Post-launch, we aimed to shift our focus from broad awareness to channels yielding the highest returns, optimizing our resource allocation for maximum efficiency.

In the competitive landscape of digital marketing, understanding the effectiveness of advertising campaigns is crucial. I was part of a recent product launch that involved running comprehensive marketing campaigns across multiple channels and sources, including Instagram, Facebook, Capterra, G2, Google Paid Search, Display and Youtube. While we had a robust marketing strategy in place, a significant challenge remained: accurately attributing conversions to the appropriate touchpoints across these channels.

As the launch progressed, it became crucial to understand the performance of our ads, the return on ad spend (ROAS), and how our target audience interacted with the ads across these channels. Post-launch, we aimed to shift our focus from broad awareness to channels yielding the highest returns, optimizing our resource allocation for maximum efficiency. Traditional single-touch attribution models were insufficient as they failed to capture the complex, multi-touch nature of customer interactions in todayâ€™s digital ecosystem.

Solution Approach
To address this challenge, I developed a multi-faceted attribution model that combined heuristic single-touch, multi-touch, and data-driven Markov chain approaches. This comprehensive approach allowed us to gain a detailed understanding of ad performance, user behavior, and the overall impact of each channel on our conversions.
